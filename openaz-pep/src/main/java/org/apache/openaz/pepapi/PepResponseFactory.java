/**
 * Factory for creating and configuring <code>PepResponse</code>.
 * <br>
 * This class creates {@link org.apache.openaz.pepapi.PepResponse} objects and configures
 * the behavior of how the <code>PepResponse</code> interprets the
 * results from the AzService or any other PDP that is supported
 * by an implementation of PepApi (org.openliberty.openaz.azapi.pep.*).
 * <br>
 * The {@link PepResponseBehavior} that is invoked when
 * {@link org.apache.openaz.pepapi.PepResponse#allowed()} is called and the associated status code
 * has been returned by the PDP and is being handled by the PepResponse
 * provider impl, can be configured to be one of:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * {@link org.apache.openaz.pepapi.PepResponse#allowed()} returns true (PERMIT: {@link PepResponseBehavior#RETURN_YES}),
 * <li>
 * {@link org.apache.openaz.pepapi.PepResponse#allowed()} returns false (DENY: {@link PepResponseBehavior#RETURN_NO}),
 * <li>
 * or{@link org.apache.openaz.pepapi.PepResponse#allowed()} throws an exception (DENY: {@link PepResponseBehavior#THROW_EXCEPTION}).
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * In general, a Permit returns true, and a Deny returns false, but there are also other types of returns,
 * including NotApplicable and Indeterminate. The configuration is to specify for each of the 4 xacml-defined
 * conditions, what the behavior will be. i.e. for each of the "special" conditions there is a choice to
 * return either true (Permit), false (Deny), or throw an Exception.
 * <p>
 * In addition, PDP-specific status codes can be specified, such that when the impl detects one of the
 * configured status codes has been returned, then the {@link PepResponseBehavior} configured for that status
 * code will be returned.
 * <p>
 * Finally, a default {@link PepResponseBehavior} may be configured for any status code that has not been
 * explicitly configured or does not have its own default provided by the impl. The default if the statusCode
 * default has not been configured is {@link PepResponseBehavior#THROW_EXCEPTION}.
 * <p>
