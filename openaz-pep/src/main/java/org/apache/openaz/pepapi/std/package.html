This package is the 
<a href="http://openaz.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openaz/test/doc/org/openliberty/openaz/pep/package-summary.html"
>OpenAz reference "implementation"</a>
of the OpenAz 
<a href="http://openaz.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openaz/test/doc/org/openliberty/openaz/azapi/pep/package-summary.html"
>"PepApi interface package"</a>,
and therefore generally contains implementation classes
and only implementation-specific interfaces, also included is a
<a href="#tutorial">PepApi tutorial</a> that describes the approach
to building a PepApi implementation for a specific authorization
provider, as well as a 2nd <a href="#tutorialmappers">Mapper tutorial</a>
that describes the overall approach to writing mappers.
<p>
The goal of this package is twofold:
<ul>
<li>The primary goal is to provide a reference implementation of PepApi
that uses an AzApi-based authorization provider, which in this case is the
<a href="http://openaz.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openaz/test/doc/org/openliberty/openaz/pdp/provider/SimpleConcreteSunXacmlService.html"
>SimpleConcreteSunXacmlService</a>, 
which is the SunXacml PDP wrapped in an
<a href="http://openaz.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openaz/test/doc/org/openliberty/openaz/pdp/package-summary.html"
>implementation of the AzApi interface</a>.
<li>The secondary goal is to provide a reference framework, which other
providers can use as a model for implementation strategy of both AzApi
and non-AzApi based authorization providers.
</ul>

In order to support the 2nd objective, the following is a high level
"tutorial" about the PepApi and this implementation of it. At present,
this tutorial is in preliminary form, however, even in the current
state, the information may prove useful to anyone who is interested in
developing an implementation of PepApi.

<H3>High Level Overview: Appl, PepApi, AzApi, AzProvider</H3></a>
<p>
To understand the "top level" picture of what is currently provided
for implementations in the OpenAz project, we can identify six layers
of operational modules (including "interfaces" as a layer). Each layer
description starts with the identifier of a jar file in the OpenAz project
that contains an implementation of the functionality described in the layer.
<p>
In addition, experience with OpenAz has shown, the PepApi is best represented
as having 2 portions: an application-oriented API, and a provider-oriented SPI,
which will be noted in the following list and explained further below.
<p>
The PepApi provider is primarily concerned with implementing Layer 3 in the
list below. The other layers are generally provided either from the OpenAz site
(layers 2,4 for interfaces, layer 1 for test code, layers 5,6 for sample
AzApi impl and PDP), or from customer application environments (layer 1,
when customer is ready to implement PepApi client), or from PDP vendors
(layers 5 and 6). 
<p>
<a name="sixlayerlist"><H4>List of the Six OpenAz Module Layers</H4></a>
<ul>
<li><b>Layer 1:</b> 
"<top-of-project>\openaz\test\build\openliberty-openaz-test.jar"
<br>
This layer is implemented by a package that contains sample test programs,
and may be thought of as the "application layer", and generally only
uses the "API" portion of PepApi. 
For example, test.TestStyles, demonstrates various usage scenarios
of PepApi. 
 
<li><b>Layer 2:</b> "<top-of-project>
"<top-of-project>\openaz\azapi\build\openliberty-openaz-azapi.jar"
<br>
This layer is implemented by a package that contains the actual 
"PepApi interfaces" (API and SPI), and may be considered to be the second layer 
of "modules", which, while not having any executable code, do control 
what code can be compiled that is purported to "implement" the interface.
(Note: Even though the jar file contains "azapi" in the name, 
it also contains the "pepapi".)

<li><b>Layer 3:</b>  
"<top-of-project>\openaz\pep\build\openliberty-openaz-pep.jar"
<br>
This package contains an example implementation of the PepApi,
and may be considered to be the "third layer" of OpenAz. 
It also contains an implementation of an "AzApi client", i.e. a
module that uses AzApi directly to make authorization decisions.
As such, this layer may be considered to both implement a PepApi
provider, as well as, in this case, an AzApi client, or in the more
general, case a client to any request-response oriented 
authorization provider.
<br>
In addition, this layer generally uses its own implementation of
the SPI portion of PepApi, which facilitates its implementation 
of the API portion.
 
<li><b>Layer 4:</b> 
"<top-of-project>\openaz\azapi\build\openliberty-openaz-azapi.jar"
<br>
This package contains the actual "interfaces" that comprise the AzApi, 
and, in the same sense as the layer 2 PepApi above, may be considered
to be a layer of modules that control compatibility with other
modules, esp in layer 5. (Note: this is the same jar file as used
by layer 2, i.e. it contains both sets of interfaces.)
 
<li><b>Layer 5:</b> 
"<top-of-project>\openaz\pdp\build\openliberty-openaz-pdp.jar"
<br>
This package contains an example implementation of AzApi, and may be 
considered to be the "fifth layer" of OpenAz. Similarly to Layer 3,
this package also contains a client implementation, where the client
in this case is to the SunXacml PDP provider.
 
<li><b>Layer 6:</b> 
"<top-of-project>/pdp/lib/sunxacml.jar" 
<br>
This jar file contains the SunXacml PDP impl, which may be considered 
as the sixth layer of modules in OpenAz.
</ul>


<a name="separationapispi">
<H3>Separation of PepApi into API and SPI parts.</H3></a>
This section first describes the approach at a high level, then
provides a detailed review of the complete PepApi interface to
designate the API and SPI parts of each PepApi interface.

<a name="highlevelsepapispi">
<H4>High level view of API/SPI separation</H4></a>
The first thing that is probably useful to recognize is that the PepApi
really consists of an application facing API plus an implementer's SPI
(Service Provider Interface).
If there is sufficient demand for a more formal separation, that will be
considered in the future.
<p>
The following is a high level view of the API/SPI separation:
<pre>
      Consider the following functionality as being the main
      part of each portion of the PepApi:

      APPL API LAYER:

	Use newPepRequest methods to build request
	Use decide() method to make decision
	Use allowed and next methods to look at results
	Use getObligations, getObligationId, getStringValues to
	     look at obligations within each result

      PROVIDER SPI LAYER:

	Take Appl Api Request and 
	  submit as Authorization Provider Request

	Take Authorization Provider Response objects and 
	  process and return them as Appl Api Response objects


      Summary of architecture:

	Appl Client Impl
	  PepApi Appl Client API 
	  PepApi Provider SPI 
	PepApi Provider Impl
	  &lt;AzProvider&gt;API  {AzProvider = Az | Xyz}
	&lt;AzProvider&gt; Impl


	Current AzApi strategy:

	        +--------------------+
	        | Appl client (impl) |          <b><i>Layer 1</i></b>
	        +--------------------+
	              |       ^
	              v       |
	+-----------------------------------+
	|   PepApi appl client api (intf)   |   <b><i>Layer 2</i></b>
	| - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - |
	|  PepApi provider api/spi (impl)   |   <b><i>Layer 3</i></b>
	|   includes use of PepApi spi      |	
	|         plus AzApi Client         |
	+-----------------------------------+
	           |             ^
	           v             |
	+-----------------------------------+
	|      AzApi client api (intf)      |   <b><i>Layer 4</i></b>
	| - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - |
	|        AzApi provider (impl)      |   <b><i>Layer 5</i></b>
	|        plus SunXacml client       |
	+-----------------------------------+
	           |             ^
	           v             |
	   +----------------------------+
	   |  SunXacml provider (impl)  |       <b><i>Layer 6</i></b>
	   +----------------------------+



	Suggested strategy for an Xyz provider:

	        +--------------------+
	        | Appl client (impl) |          <b><i>Layer 1</i></b>
	        +--------------------+
	              |       ^
	              v       |
	+-----------------------------------+
	|   PepApi appl client api (intf)   |   <b><i>Layer 2</i></b>
	| - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - |
	|  PepApi provider api/spi (impl)   |   <b><i>Layer 3</i></b>
	| includes use of custom PepApi spi |	
	|        plus XyzApi Client         |
	+-----------------------------------+
	           |             ^
	           v             |
	+-----------------------------------+
	|     <i>XyzApi client api</i> (intf)      |   <b><i>Layer 4</i></b>
	| - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - |
	|       XyzApi provider (impl)      |   <b><i>Layers 5,6</i></b>
	+-----------------------------------+


</pre>
Note: because in the XyzApi provider case, the "standard" api is effectively
the XyzApi, itself, there is no need for the impl to act as a client to a
different interface, and so layers 5 and 6 are effectively consolidated to
a single logical layer.

<a name="detailsepapispi">
<H4>Detail list of API/SPI separated methods</H4></a>
The following list of interfaces and methods describe the API/SPI
separation. 
<p>Note 
<ul>
<li>There are only a few interfaces and methods involved with
the application-facing API, namely: 
<ul>
<li>PepRequestFactory
<li>PepRequest
<li>PepResponse
<li>Obligation
</ul>
<li>All the PepApi interfaces are used and/or include methods that appear
in the SPI portion.
<li>Methods marked with "**" have AzApi-specific items in the interface
that need to be addressed by non-AzApi implementations. In most cases,
simply making the item null will satisfactorily address the situation for
a non-AzApi implementation, however, it is likely that a corresponding
element of the implementation will need to be used instead to fulfill
the functional capability. For example, a non-AzApi impl will have no
use for an AzRequestContext, however, it will likely have its own
RequestContext that will need to be considered as an alternative which
can be included in an extension class that has an additional provider-specific
method.
Note: items marked with "**" are followed by comment at end of line
with number referring to the suggested approaches for these issues
described at the end of the SPI detail section.

<a name="suggestedspiapproaches">
<H4>Suggested approaches for XyzApi provider SPI implementation</H4></a>
<pre>
Note: these suggestions presume the Xyz provider is following the
code structure in the org.openliberty.openaz.pep impl package
and that the approach is to substitute Xyz request and response objects,
and Xyz entity attribute collections for those provided by AzApi.
The basic idea would be to have a parallel impl, for example: 
org.openliberty.openaz.xyz, with basically the same set of classes,
but with some of the following modifications considered.

	1. return null for getAz&lt;object&gt;() in:
		PepRequestFactory.getAzService()
		PepRequest.getAzRequestContext()
		Attributes&lt;T&gt;.getAzEntity()
		PepResponse.getAzResponseContext()

	2. Pass null for az&lt;object&gt; parameter in:
		PepResponseFactory.createPepResponse(azResponseContext, ...)
		ResponseAttributesFactory.createObject(azEntity)
		ObligationFactory.createObject(azEntity)

	3. Consider extending AzResourceActionAssociation as
	   XyzResourceActionAssociation and use in the following:

		PepRequest.getActionObject(AzResourceActionAssociation azRaa) 
		PepRequest.getResourceObject(AzResourceActionAssociation azRaa) 

		PepResponseFactory.createPepResponse(
			Set&lt;AzResourceActionAssociation&gt; azRaas, 
			PepRequest pepRequest, 
			boolean queryAllowed) 

	   AzResourceActionAssociation javadoc is here:
	     http://openaz.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openaz/test/doc/org/openliberty/openaz/azapi/AzResourceActionAssociation.html

	   Within XyzResourceActionAssociation extension return null for the 
	   following AzApi-dependent methods:

 		AzResourceActionAssociation.getAzAction() 
		AzResourceActionAssociation.getAzResource() 
		AzResourceActionAssociation.getAzResourceActionAssociationId() 
 
	   Add new XyzResourceActionAssociation method to return
	   action and resource objects:

		XyzObject getXyzAction()
		XyzObject getXyzResource()

	   Then the XyzResourceActionAssociation object can be used
	   for correlation based on the XyzObject references for
	   action and resource in the XyzPepRequestImpl that
	   implement PepRequest, i.e.

		PepRequest.getActionObject(XyzResourceActionAssociation xyzRaa) 
		PepRequest.getResourceObject(XyzResourceActionAssociation xyzRaa) 

	   Similarly for creating a collection of return objects
	   in response to a query, the XyzPepResponseFactoryImpl
	   should be able to pass:

		PepResponseFactory.createPepResponse(
			Set&lt;XyzResourceActionAssociation&gt; xyzRaas, 
			PepRequest pepRequest, 
			boolean queryAllowed) 

	   although one needs to check if generics will allow this pass
	   of a Set of subclasses of the class for which the interface
	   is defined.

<a name="somediscussion"><h3>Some discussion items</h3></a>

<a name="basicpattern"><h4>Basic Processing Pattern</h4></a>
The basic pattern is that the "container" of applications provides
both checking requests before the application receives them, and
checking requests in the process of application execution, where
it is necessary to determine if the current user has sufficient
authorization established to continue the current operation.
<p>

<a name="highlowinterfaces">
<h4>High Level and Low Level Interface Layers</h4></a>
PepApi is a "high level interface" intended to be totally flexible
in terms of the applications and containers that can use it, and
to also be "easy to use", comparable to existing platform-specific
authorization models, such as J2SE checkPermission and WebLogic
isAccessAllowed.
<p>
By contrast, AzApi is a "low level interface" intended to provide
a Java binding to the more general platform independent XACML
authorization model, which provides a general interface consisting
of a collection of collections of "canonical" Attributes that contain
both Attribute metadata and AttributeValues.
<p>

<a name="basicpurpose"><h4>Basic Purpose of PepApi</h4></a>
Therefore, the intended purpose of a PepApi Impl, for example,
this package ({@link org.openliberty.openaz.pep}), is
to provide a "mapping" from the simple, application-friendly, PepApi
that the applications (and containers) use, to the more complex
AzApi, that the container would then typically use
to submit requests to standard XACML PDPs.
<p>

<a name="standardpdps"><h4>Standard PDPs</h4></a>
"Standard XACML PDPs" are accessed using the XACML 
Request/Response protocol, which is described in the XACML 
specifications using XML to represent the details. However, 
implementations are not required to use XML, but they are
required to maintain the semantics of XACML, which are normatively
defined in the specifications using the XML representation.
<p>

<a name="xacmlreps"><h4>Representations of XACML</h4></a>
Furthermore, the XACML specifications do not specify what
representation is required in the PEP-PDP connection, so it is
possible that one end is expecting to use XML and the other
end is expecting to use some other serialization format of the
same information. Therefore, interoperability is somewhat
dependent on the "bindings" that XACML PEP and XACML PDPs have
provided for support. In the absence of a match, it would be
up to the vendors and/or enterprise system developers to either
provide a translation module or to simply select another 
product that would be compatible.
<p>
It is not a goal of either the XACML Technical Committee nor
of the OpenAz project to attempt to resolve this issue, except
on an as-needed basis to serve the purposes of implementations
that are used within or want to integrate with the OpenAz Project.
<p>
So, for example, the initial release of OpenAz has, effectively,
two "providers" for AzApi, the top level classes of which are:
<a href="http://openaz.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openaz/test/doc/org/openliberty/openaz/pdp/provider/SimpleConcreteDummyService.html">
<b>SimpleConcreteDummyService</b></a> and 
<a href="http://openaz.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openaz/test/doc/org/openliberty/openaz/pdp/provider/SimpleConcreteSunXacmlService.html">
<b>SimpleConcreteSunXacmlService</b></a>. 
The former, the "dummy service",
simply gives canned responses, and should be regarded as no more than
a test tool, however, its existence as an independent "provider" may
be useful for some types of demos.
<p>

<a name="openazreleases"><h4>OpenAz Release Philosophy</h4></a>
To understand the working example in the "initial release of OpenAz"
(which is the current release, which should be considered to be
using the interfaces, i.e. AzApi and PepApi, in their "final form".
The "final form" is "final" in the sense that until there is a critical
mass (for example 3 implementations, including the current ref impl),
fixes to "bugs" found in either API should be considered fair game.
However, any "functionality" above and beyond what is currently
represented as the functionality of those interfaces, should be
considered candidates for a "second" or "next" release.)
 
<a name="thesixlayersdisc"><H4>The Six Layers</H4></a>
One may think of the 6 layers as kind of a "stepladder" of mapping
the Objects from the local form within the application (Layer 1) to the 
canonical form within AzApi (Layer 5).
<p>

<a name="layer5disc"><H5>Layer 5: AzApi Impl</H5></a>
Then, from the AzApi impl (layer 5) the canonical form objects may
be mapped a 2nd time into the local object form required by the 
XACML PDP.

From the perspective of the six layers, we can examine some of the
possible "usage scenarios" for OpenAz. It turns out that there
really are two major pieces of standardization that OpenAz facilitates:

<ul>
<li> First is the upper level "PepApi" (layer two), which provides
a standard Java interface to application environments, regardless
of the specific Objects the applications pass to PepApi. 

<ul>
<li>Note: It is "standard" in the sense that 
applications do not have to be aware that
what is done with the Objects when they are passed to PepApi.
is that the Objects are "mapped" by the 
layer 3 PepApi Impl to be used as input to the layer 4 AzApi
interface.
</ul>

<li> Second is the lower level "AzApi" (layer four), which provides
a standard Java interface to XACML PDPs.

<ul>
<li>Note: Again that the layer 5 AzApi Impl needs to generally
"map" the AzApi objects to those of the XACML Impl.
</ul> 
</ul>

The reason that layer 5 may need to do mapping is the existing
XACML implementations, in general, will not yet be using AzApi,
and so the most effective path to use AzApi is to implement a
mapping to the current objects used by the XACML PDP.
<ul>
<li> In fact, this is exactly what is done in the OpenAz layer five, 
where the AzApi top level impl,
<a href="http://openaz.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openaz/test/doc/org/openliberty/openaz/pdp/provider/SimpleConcreteSunXacmlService.html">
<b>SimpleConcreteSunXacmlService</b></a>, 
wraps the SunXacml PDP, which has its own interface, 
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://sunxacml.sourceforge.net/javadoc/com/sun/xacml/PDP.html#evaluate(com.sun.xacml.ctx.RequestCtx)">
ResponseCtx response = PDP.evaluate(RequestCtx request)</a>
</ul>
</ul>

<a name="azapivssunxacml"><H4>AzApi vs SunXacml</H4></a>

<p>
While the SunXacml interface is "similar" to the AzApi interface, 
particularly the AzApi "decide()" call 
<p>
<a href="http://openaz.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openaz/test/doc/org/openliberty/openaz/azapi/AzService.html#decide(org.openliberty.openaz.azapi.AzRequestContext)">
<b>AzService.decide</b></a>
(
<a href="http://openaz.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openaz/test/doc/org/openliberty/openaz/azapi/AzRequestContext.html">
<b>AzRequestContext</b></a>
};

<ul>
<li> AzResponseContext azRspCtx = AzService.decide(AzRequestContext azReqCtx)
</ul>

<p>
there is still a "mapping" required to go from the AzApi implementation
objects to the SunXacml implementation objects. i.e. one must map the
AzApi 
<a href="http://sunxacml.sourceforge.net/javadoc/com/sun/xacml/ctx/RequestCtx.html">
<b>RequestCtx</b></a>
to the SunXacml and on the return, map the SunXacml 
<a href="http://sunxacml.sourceforge.net/javadoc/com/sun/xacml/ctx/ResponseCtx.html">
<b>ResponseCtx</b></a> to the AzApi 
<a href="http://openaz.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openaz/test/doc/org/openliberty/openaz/azapi/AzResponseContext.html">
<b>AzResponseContext</b></a>


<a name="canonicalform"><H4>Canonical Form</H4></a>
Given the above description, one may ask why map to the canonical form
at all? Why not have layer 3 map directly to the local form of the 
PDP, and therefore skip layers 4 and 5?

<ul>
<li>In fact, the architecture is designed so that is a perfectly
legitimate strategy to take. However, the major drawback to this strategy
is that if the enterprise has a mix of PDPs from multiple vendors,
then configuration may begin to become complex, as one must keep track
of which vendor's PDP is servicing which application, so as to ensure
that the proper mappers are in place to map from the application
objects to the specific PDP vendor objects.

<li>From a purely technical engineering for performance perspective,
it may appear that the benefit of an intermediate canonical form in
the runtime path, as kind of a standard "clearinghouse" is not 
compelling enough on its own to justify the effort to achieve it.

<li>However, there are additional considerations. Security Policy
is an all-encompassing concern for an enterprise that generally 
applies to every activity conducted by the enterprise, whether
for concern of privacy, risk-avoidance, compliance, integrity, etc.,
there needs to be a way to integrate security Policy to any activity.

<li>In order to effectively manage security Policy, there needs to
be standard representations of the information in those Policies,
as well as a method to relate that information to the corresponding
representation of information in the enterprise that is collected
and assembled to a Request to be evaluated by Policy.
</ul>

<H3>High Level Overview: Mappers</H3></a>
At the most fundamental level, the philosophy of OpenAz and PepApi/AzApi
that the process of authorization can be abstracted as Policy defined in
terms of "entities" represented as collections of "attributes", where the
entities and attributes can be represented by a common standard such
as XACML. Therefore, in theory, all that is required at runtime when an
authorization check is required is to look at the entities involved and
evaluate the Policy to determine if the attributes of the entities meet
the Policy criteria for granting access.
<p>
The "entities" involved in a typical access check include:
<ul>
<li>A User Entity, or "Subject", where the Subject is the entity that
is requesting access.
<li>A Resource Entity, where the Resource is the entity to which the
User Entity is requesting access.
<li>An Action Entity, where the action specifies the explicit operations
that the User Entity is requesting to apply to the Resource Entity.
<li>An optional Environment Entity, where the "environment" is generally
to be considered system conditions, such as time of day, that may factor
into the decision making process. All such attributes are generally 
collected in an Environment Entity collection of Attributes.
</li>
</ul>
In the XACML Specification, all attributes are of a specific XACML
DataType, which means, as described in XACML Specification Section A.2:
<pre>
  A.2. Data-types
  
    Although XML instances represent all data-types as strings,
    an XACML PDP must reason about types of data that, while they
    have string representations, are not just strings. 
    
    Types such as Boolean, integer and double MUST be converted:
    
        - from their XML string representations
        - to values that can be compared with values in their domain
          of discourse, such as numbers.
</pre>
(Note: the XACML Specification uses both the term "data-type" and the
term "DataType", where the former refers to a generic notion of a
"data type", but within the XACML context, thus also implicitly
referring to the latter term, "DataType", which is the name of the
"XML attribute" used to specify the specific instance of XACML 
data-type to be used in conjunction with the XACML Attribute element
that contains both the DataType attribute and AttributeValue element.
OpenAz will not make such a distinction and simply use the term "DataType"
or "datatype" interchangeably to in any of these contexts.)
<p>
In OpenAz, the "lower level" AzApi contains a separate interface for each
of the Xacml DataTypes and a specific Java Object Type is also associated
with each Xacml DataType. The collection of 
<a href="http://openaz.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openaz/test/doc/org/openliberty/openaz/azapi/AzAttributeValue.html"
>AzAttributeValue subinterfaces</a>
along with the associated list of "Known Implementing Classes" that reference
the reference impl implementations of these interfaces, effectively can
be considered the specification of the "AzApi Java Language Binding".
<p>
As such, in order to make an AzRequest to a XACML PDP, one needs to
collect the attributes associated with each entity (where the entities
are distinguished by 
<a href ="">AzCategoryId</a> and submit the Java objects containing the
attribute values thru these standard interfaces.
<p>
The purpose of the lower level AzApi interface is to provide a
well-structured framework that has a standard representation of all
information that may ultimately prove necessary to submit a complete
authorization request.
<p>
However, in general, information in the runtime environment is not
in any particular standard form, so, in order to enable minimal impact
on existing runtime development practices, the PepApi was developed to
enable applications to submit whatever information objects are preferred
to be used in a particular application environment. 
<p>
In order to make this strategy work the PepApi implementation needs to
"map" the information in the objects supplied by the application from
that environment-specific form to the AzApi standard form, which will
then enable seamless submission to a XACML PDP.
<p>
However, as described in the first tutorial above, the same strategy 
will work with almost any PDP. This second tutorial will explain how
the reference impl mappers are designed, and it is expected that the
same design strategy can be applied to mapping to other PDP APIs,
as well, where instead of mapping application objects to azapi objects,
the mapping would be to the non-Xacml-PDP-specific objects.
<H3>How to build a Mapper</H3>
Probably the most straight-forward way to explain how to build a mapper
is to explain how the existing mappers provided in PepApi work.
<a name="structuremappers"><h4>Mapper structure</h4></a>
Looking at the javadoc for 
<a href="http://openaz.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openaz/test/doc/org/openliberty/openaz/pep/SimpleJavaObjectMapper.html"
>org.openliberty.openaz.pep.SimpleJavaObjectMapper</a> as a
typical example, we can make the following observations about its structure:
<ul>
<li>It implements the 
<a href="http://openaz.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openaz/test/doc/org/openliberty/openaz/azapi/pep/JavaObjectMapper.html"
>org.openliberty.openaz.azapi.pep.JavaObjectMapper</a>
interface.
<li>The javadoc says that it supports 3 objects: String, Date, and HashMap,
and that it maps those objects into RequestAttributes.
<li>The 3 JavaObjectMapper interface methods: canMapObject(), map(), and
getSupportedObjects() appear in the Method Summary for the 
SimpleJavaObjectMapper.
<li>There are additional methods used within the implementation: 
convertDate, convertString, convertMap. These methods do the actual
conversion of the application input object to the AzAttribute structures.
</ul>
<a name="methodimplmappers"><h4>Mapper method implementation</h4></a>
<h5>getSupportedObjects</h5>
Implementation of getSupportedObjects() in SimpleJavaObjectMapper is
to simply create a set containing a class object for each class that
the mapper supports. This is simply a hard-coded set which can be used
when configuring mappers to preliminarily determine object types supported.
<p>
For the SimpleJavaObjectMapper, this consists of a list of 3 class types:
String, Date, HashMap.
<h5>canMapObject</h5>
Implementation of canMapObject(Object obj) should be straight-forward.
In SimpleJavaObjectMapper there is simply a sequence of "if statements"
that use "instanceof" to test whether the obj parameter is an "instanceof"
one of the supported object classes. If there is a match then true
is returned, otherwise false is returned.
<h5>map</h5>
Implementation of the 
<a href="http://openaz.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openaz/test/doc/org/openliberty/openaz/azapi/pep/JavaObjectMapper.html#map(java.lang.Object,%20org.openliberty.openaz.azapi.pep.RequestAttributes)"
>map(Object obj, RequestAttributes<T> reqAttrs)</a> method is the
only place where there might be some non-trivial complexity to work thru.
<p>
In SimpleJavaObjectMapper, map(obj,reqAttrs) dispatches to a conversion
method for one of the supported object types by going thru a similar
sequence of "if instanceof" test and dispatching when a matching object
class is found.
<p>
Within the conversion methods, the first thing considered is the AzCategoryId
of the RequestAttributes target object, which for AzApi is an AzEntity
AzAttribute collection. When the Mapper.map method is invoked, the caller
needs to determine which AzCategoryId to pass to the method as the 
generic parameter T of the RequestAttributes<T> object being passed.
<p>
Generally, this will be implicitly determined by the entity for which
the object being converted is intended. In the 
<a href="http://openaz.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openaz/test/doc/org/openliberty/openaz/azapi/pep/PepRequestFactory.html"
>PepApi PepRequestFactory.newPepRequest(*) methods</a>,
the objects passed are in an order that determines whether the object is
to be considered a Subject, Action, Resource, or Environment as
described in the signature to the newPepRequest methods. 
<p>
One can get a rough idea of how this is implemented by following the 
<a href="#pepapiseqmodel">PepApi sequence model</a> in the first tutorial
above. In particular, starting with PepRequestFactoryImpl call to
setAccessSubject(sObj), one can follow the diagram logic down to
the RequestAttributes.setAttribute(attrId, subjObj) method where the
Mapper has been invoked and the convertObject method within the Mapper
is setting the attribute on the AzEntity.
<a name="permissionmappers"><H4>Permission Mapper</H4></a>
A slightly more interesting case is the 
<a href="http://openaz.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openaz/test/doc/org/openliberty/openaz/pep/SimpleJavaPermissionMapper.html">SimpleJavaPermissionMapper</a>
<p>
As described in the javadoc for
<a href="http://openaz.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openaz/test/doc/org/openliberty/openaz/pep/SimpleJavaPermissionMapper.html#map(java.lang.Object,%20org.openliberty.openaz.azapi.pep.RequestAttributes)"
>SimpleJavaPermissionMapper.map()</a>
a Permission or any subclass of Permission can be processed and effectively
serialized into 3 String parameters, where the Permission subclass is assumed
to be a "resource-type", the name parameter is assumed to be the "resource-id",
and the action is assumed to be the "action-id", where resource-id and action-id
are as defined in Xacml, and resource-type is an OpenAz identifier used to
name a resource type.
<p>
Therefore these 3 parameters can be passed to the Xacml PDP and generally
policies will contain regular expression conditions on resource name in order
to create scopes of resources and actions subject to the policy. Some examples
demonstrating this technique are included in the test program
<a href="http://openaz.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openaz/test/doc/test/TestStyles.html"
>TestStyles</a>
where the code and javadoc of the testStyle* methods describe some of 
the test cases, and the 
<a href="http://openaz.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openaz/test/src/test/"
>code from the project</a>
 may be examined.
