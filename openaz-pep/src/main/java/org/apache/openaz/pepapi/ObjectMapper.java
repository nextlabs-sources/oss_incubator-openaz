 * a general approach allowing a Domain Type to be mapped to multiple categories. The conversion for the most
 * part involves obtaining a <code>CategoryAttributes</code> instance for a specific category from the request
 * context and then mapping Object properties as name-value pairs using one of the overloaded
 * <code>setAttribute</code> methods.
