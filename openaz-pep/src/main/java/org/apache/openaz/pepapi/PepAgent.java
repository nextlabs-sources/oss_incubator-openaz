/**
 * Serves as the main entry point into the PepAPI framework. It coordinates authorization request creation,
 * execution and response assemblage. Applications typically work with a single instance of PepAgent which is
 * thread-safe. The <code>decide()</code> method, which provides the most general mechanism for authorization,
 * accepts a collection of application Domain Objects, each with its own <code>ObjectMapper</code> defined.
 * The client application thus passes these Domain Objects directly, <code>decide()</code> uses reflection to
 * determine their type, and then finds a type-specific mapper. This mechanism relies on application defined
 * library of Object Mappers, one for each Domain Object that the client program expects to use in an
 * authorization call. It is important to note that Java Primitives/Wrappers and other standard types(except
 * Collections) are not supported out of the box. This is primarily because there is no sensible default
 * mapping between a Java Standard Type and a XACML category and hence it's impossible for the framework to
 * make a mapping decision at runtime. However, client applications may enforce their own rules as they see
 * fit by providing Custom ObjectMapper(s) for these types. <code>simpleDecide()</code> method addresses the
 * simplest of use cases where attributes involved are simple userId, actionId and resourceId Strings.
 * <code>bulkDecide()</code> provides an abstraction for a MultiRequest, where in client applications may
 * provide collection of Domain Object bindings/associations each of which map to individual requests. The
 * method separates out Domain Object associations with multiple cardinality from the ones shared across
 * requests. Thus, in a <code>bulkDecide()</code> call applications provide two sets of arguments: - a List of
 * Domain Object bindings, each of which map to an individual request. - a collection of common Domain Objects
 * shared across all requests. Specific AzService implementations(PDP Providers) may implement bulkDecide() as
 * a XACML MultiRequest (Note: XACML Multi Decision Profile is optional) or as individual requests executed
 * iteratively.
